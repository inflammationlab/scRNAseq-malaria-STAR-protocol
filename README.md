## Raw Data

The raw sequencing data has been submitted to ArrayExpress under the accession number [E-MTAB-10939](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/arrayexpress/studies/E-MTAB-10939?query=E-MTAB-10939).

## Data Analyses

Data analysis notebooks (see `report` folder) and scripts (see `scripts`) used in the analysis of two single-cell RNA-seq samples of red blood cells infected with _Plasmodium chabaudi_ (G6pc1fl/lfl and G6pc1AlbΔ/Δ) published in _Cell Metabolism_: [A hypometabolic defense strategy against malaria](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2022.06.011). 

The G6pc1fl/lfl (or `gt1` in the STAR protocol) and G6pc1AlbΔ/Δ (`gt2`) samples described in the paper correspond to `Lox2` and `Cre3` in the code. 

   + `report`: all the R markdown and ipython notebooks

   + `scripts`: bash and R scripts supporting the analyses
